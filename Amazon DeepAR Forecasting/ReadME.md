# Forecasting-with-DeepAR

DeepAR forecasting algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm for forecasting time series using recurrent neural networks (RNN).
DeepAR can be trained on one or more related time series to predict future horizons given the preceding context. 
Since Itâ€™s a probabilistic model It will predict single best values for time index, the model parametrizes a parametric probability 
distribution for each time index.
